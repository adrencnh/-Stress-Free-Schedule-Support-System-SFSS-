                    Stress-Free Schedule Support (or SFSS) provides students with an interactive and intuitive medium through which they can 
                    plan their course schedules in a tailored way that takes their needs and desires into account.
                </li>
                <li>
                    SFSS includes two main tools: "Plan Your Timetable" and "Elective Suggestion." With "Plan Your Timetable," you can enter
                    your courses and all their available sections as well as your timetable preferences in order to generate a timetable
                    that best fits your desires (i.e. early days). With "Elective Suggestion," you can enter subjects that you are interested in
                    to generate a list of relevant courses.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The goal of the system is to focus on user experience by making the formerly stressful process of course selection
                    and timetable creation satisfying, accessible, rewarding, and easy to use.
